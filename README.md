To be honest, I'm so obssesed with wallpapers. I think it's the most important thing to have a beautiful desktop environment and I wanted to share them with the people and keep them in a repository just in case I lose them, so with that being said, I hope everyone you like it!

## Where did I get them?
I've been collecting these wallpapers for a long time and I've got mostly from this [r/wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/) subreddit, but also I often visit [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

## Style of wallpapers
There is a lot of variety, you have nature, landscapes, superheroes and many others topics to put on your desktop.
