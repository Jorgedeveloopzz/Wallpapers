## ‚ùì Where do I get them?

I've been collecting these wallpapers for a long time and I've got mostly from this [r/wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/) subreddit, but also I often visit [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

## üñåÔ∏è Style of wallpapers

There is a lot of variety, you have nature, landscapes, superheroes and many others topics to put on your desktop.

- If you wanna have them: `git clone https://github.com/Jorgedeveloopzz/Wallpapers.git` or [download the ZIP](https://github.com/jorgeloopzz/Wallpapers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
